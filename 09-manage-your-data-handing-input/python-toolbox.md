## Python Lingo
* `Database API` - a standardized mechanism for accessing an SQL - based database system from within a Python program.

## Database Lingo
* `Database` - a collection of one or more table.
* `Table` - a collection of one or more rows or data, arranged as one or more columns.
* `SQL` - the "Structured Query Language" is the language of the database world and it lets you work with your data in your database using statements such as CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT.

## Bullet Points
* The `filedStorage()` method from the standard library's `cgi` module lets you access data sent to your web server from within your CGI script.
* The standard `os` library includes the `environ` dictionary providing convenient access to your program's environment setting.
* The `SQLite` database system is included within Python as the `sqlite3` standard library.
* The `connect()` method establishes a connection to your database file.
* The `cursor()` method lets you communicate with your database via an existing cursor.
* The `execute()` method lets you send an SQL query to your database via an existing cursor.
* The `commit()` method makes changes to your database permanent.
* The `rollback()` method cancels any pending changes to your data.
* The `close()` method closes an existing connection to your database.
* The `?` placeholder lets you parameterize SQL statements within your Python code.
