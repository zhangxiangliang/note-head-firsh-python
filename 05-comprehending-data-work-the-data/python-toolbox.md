## Python Lingo
* 'In-place' sorting - transforms and then repleaces.
* 'copied' sorting - transforms and then returns.
* 'method chaining' - reading from left to right, applies a collection of methods to data.
* 'function chaining' - reading from right to left, applies a collection of functions to data.

* 'list comprehension' - specify a transformation on one line (as opposed to using an iteration).
* 'slice' - access more than one item fro a list.
* 'set' - a collection of unordered data items that contains no duplicates.

## Bullet Points
* The `sort()` method changes the ordering of lists in-place.
* The `sorted()` BIF sorts most any data structure by providing copied sorting.
* Pass `reverse=True` to either `sort()` or `sorted()` to arrange your data in `descending` order.
* use `new_l = [len(t) for t in old_l]` as opposed to usisng an iteration.
* To access more than one data item from a list, use a slice.
* Create a set use `set()` factory function.
