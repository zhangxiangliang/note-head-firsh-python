## Python Lingo

* "Dictionary" - a build-in data structure that allows you to associate data values with keys.
* "Key" - the look-up part of the dictionary.
* "Value" - the data part of the dictionary(which can be any value, including another data structure).
* "self" - a method argument that always refers to the current object instance.

## Bullet Point
* Create a empty `list` using the `list()` factory function or using [].
* Create a empty `dictionary` using the `dict()` factory function or using {}.
* Like list and set, a Python's dictionary dynamically grows as new data is added to the data structure.
* The `class` keyword lets you defined a class.
* The `class methods` are defined in much the same way as functions, that is, with the `def` keyword.
* The `class attributes` are just like variables that exist within object instances.
* The `__init__()` method can be defined within a class to initialize object instances.
* Every method definedd in a class must provide `self` as its first argument.
* Every attribute in a class must be prefixed with `self`. In order to associate it data with its instance.
* Classes can be built from scratch or can `inherit` from Python's built-in classes or from other custom classes.
