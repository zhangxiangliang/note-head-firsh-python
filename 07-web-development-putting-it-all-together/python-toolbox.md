## Bullet Points
* The Model-View-Controller pattern lets you design and build a webapp in a maintainable way.
* The `model` stores your webapp's data.
* The `view` displays your webapp's user interface.
* The `controller` glues everyting together with programmed logic.
* The standard library `string` module includes a class call `Template`, which supports simple string substitutions.
* The standard library `http.server` module can be used to build a simple web server in Python.
* The standard library `cgi` module provides support for writing CGI scripts.
* The standard library `glob` module is great for working with lists of filenames.
* Set the `executable` bit with the `chmod +x` command on Unix.
* The standard library `cgitb` module, when enabled, lets you see CGI coding errors within your browser.
* Use `cgitb.enable()` to switch on CGI tracking in your CGI code.
* Use `cgi.FieldStroge()` to access data sent to a web server as part of a web request, the data arrives as a Python dictionary.
